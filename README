  DESCRIPTION  
=================

	This project was developed within the Sapo Open Source program, 
Sapo Summerbits.

	The goal of the project is to facilitate the package installation by
creating a kit. A kit is group of applications that are related, also known
as a metapackage for all debian based systems. 
	The project is separated into two aplications, one for creating kits 
and one to handle the installation process. These applications are intended
to be as simple as they can, so that any user (new/normal or advanced) can use it.
	
	This way a professor can compile a kit for his students with his favorite 
applications, a friend can share with another friend his favorit audio tools 
or a user can simply make a system backup.
